Vocal Effects Lab
Your personal open-source sound lab for exploring, creating, and applying revolutionary real-time vocal effects.

Looking for more than just voice change, but unlimited creative freedom? Vocal Effects Lab is an experimental environment where you become a sound designer. Break your voice down into its components, transform it beyond recognition, and reassemble it into something unique. There are no ready-made templates here—just tools for inventing your own sound.

Enter the lab. Experiment. Create something that doesn't exist.

Key Features
Modular Effects System (Node-Based Engine): A visual editor where you connect sound processing “nodes” (modules) like in a synthesizer. Combine noise generators, filters (high-pass, low-pass, band-pass), distortion, pitch shifters, delays, and reverbs in endless chains.

Deep synthesis and spectral processing: Enter the world of waveforms and frequencies. Use a vocoder to overlay the spectrum of one sound onto another, apply granular synthesis to a voice to create a “cloud” of its particles, and manipulate formants.

Advanced sampling and morphing: Record a phrase, cut it into phonemes, and create a library for speech synthesis. Use morphing algorithms to smoothly transform your voice into that of a famous character or a completely synthetic timbre.
Powerful sequencer and automation: Program changes to effect parameters over time. Create complex vocal “transformations” that unfold in seconds: from a whisper to a mechanical roar with a moving filter.

Live performance mode: Assign macros (groups of parameters), entire effect chains, or samples to MIDI controllers, keys, or gamepad buttons. Control your voice in real time like a musical instrument.

DAW and streaming integration: Works as a VST3/AU plugin in any digital audio workstation (Reaper, Ableton, FL Studio) and as a standalone application with a virtual audio device for OBS, Discord.

How it works and security
Local computing lab: All DSP (digital signal processing) is performed on your computer's processor. Not a single byte of audio data is transmitted over the network. Your voice experiments are your intellectual property, protected by the application's architecture.

Transparency down to the algorithm level: Open source code means that you can not only check the code for malware, but also study how each filter and synthesizer is implemented. It is an educational tool for understanding digital sound.

Deterministic environment: The program does not have access to the file system outside of its configuration folders and does not keep hidden logs. Its behavior is completely predictable and verifiable.

Sandbox mode for learning: Turn on the built-in oscilloscope, spectrum analyzer, and level meters to visually study the impact of each effect on the signal without affecting the output.

Who is this lab built for?
Content creators and streamers: To generate unique character voices, sound effects, and atmospheric effects that no one else has.

Musicians and electronic producers: To process vocals, create unique textures, and design sound from scratch.

Sound designers for games and movies: For rapid prototyping of creature voices, robots, magical beings, and atmospheres.

Researchers and enthusiasts of digital sound (DSP): For experimenting with synthesis and processing algorithms in a user-friendly visual environment.

Educators: For visually demonstrating the principles of sound effects and synthesis to students.

Important warning about ethical use
Vocal Effects Lab is a tool for creative expression and sound innovation.

Content responsibility: You are solely responsible for any audio material created using this tool. It is prohibited to create content that violates the law (defamation, threats, fraud) or harms others.
Respect for privacy: It is strictly prohibited to secretly process or record other people's voices without their explicit and informed consent.

Academic integrity: When using algorithms or code from this project in academic or commercial works, appropriate citation is required (see license).
Why choose Vocal Effects Lab?
Not effects, but a constructor: You are not limited by presets — you create them.

Professional sound and minimal latency: Powerful enough for studio work.

Educational value: Clear visualization makes complex DSP accessible.

Community of sound explorers: Share your created modules and entire effect chains with other users.

Sovereignty over sound: Your creativity doesn't depend on subscriptions or online services.
